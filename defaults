# Sleep proxy (sproxy) configuration options

# Sproxy regularly attempts to determine if the devices it's monitoring are
# asleep.  This setting specifies the length of time to wait (in seconds)
# between sleep checks.
DEVICE_CHECK_PERIOD=10

# Setting 'true' causes sproxy to use gratuitous ARP messages to proactively
# keep the network up-to-date on changing ARP status.  For example, when
# sproxy detects that a device has gone asleep and assumes their IP address,
# a 'true' setting here will cause a gratuitous ARP to be issued that updates
# all network devices with this change.  Otherwise network devices will not
# know of ARP changes until they request a new mapping, which generally
# happens only after waiting through long time-outs, so a 'true' setting here
# can increase responsiveness.
